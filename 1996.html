				<h1>Pathfinder</h1>
				<p>Mars Pathfinder was launched December 4, 1996 and landed on Mars' Ares Vallis on July 4, 1997. It was designed as a technology demonstration of a new way to deliver an instrumented lander and the first-ever robotic rover to the surface of the red planet. Pathfinder not only accomplished this goal but also returned an unprecedented amount of data and outlived its primary design life.</p>
				<p>Both the lander and the 23-pound (10.6 kilogram) rover carried instruments for scientific observations and to provide engineering data on the new technologies being demonstrated. Included were scientific instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere, climate, geology and the composition of its rocks and soil. Mars Pathfinder used an innovative method of directly entering the Martian atmosphere, assisted by a parachute to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere and a giant system of airbags to cushion the impact.</p>

				<h1>Mars Global Surveyor</h1>
				<p>Launched November 7, 1996, Mars Global Surveyor became the first successful mission to the red planet in two decades. After a year and a half spent trimming its orbit from a looping ellipse to a circular track around the planet, the spacecraft began its prime mapping mission in March 1999. It has continued to observe the planet from a low-altitude, nearly polar orbit ever since.</p>
				<p>The mission has studied the entire Martian surface, atmosphere, and interior. One of the most exciting observations of the spacecraft's wide-angle camera system, known as the Mars Orbital Camera, is that the red planet has very repeatable weather patterns. Each day the camera operates, it collects images that are used to build up a daily global map. These maps provide a record of changing meteorological conditions on Mars. Weather patterns observed by the spacecraft include some dust storms that repeat in the same location within a week or two of the time they occurred in the previous year. In addition, local disturbances and dust devils may start up at any time after the first day of spring and continue until Martian autumn.</p>
				<p>By studying Mars for several Martian years (a Mars year is about twice as long as an Earth year), Mars Global Surveyor has has observed gully formation, new boulder tracks, recently formed impact craters, and diminishing amounts of carbon dioxide ice within the south polar cap. Data from the spacecraft's laser altimeter has given scientists their first 3-D views of Mars' north polar ice cap. Changes in radio transmissions as they are refracted by the Martian atmosphere have enabled scientists to create vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and pressure. Spacecraft accelerations due to gravity have given scientists a better understanding of the interior of Mars. Findings such as these have shown that Mars is a dynamic planet with a history of seasonal and long-term change recorded in the planet's surface.</p>
